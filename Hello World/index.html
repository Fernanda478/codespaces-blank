 <p>In the year 2000, only 50% of US Adults said they used the internet, and less than 5% of homes had high speed internet access. That means a lot of things we found common place couldn't be done yet!

 <h3>Things you couldn't do in 2000:</h3>
 <ul>
  <li>Post a selfie on social media</li>
  <li>Watch youtube videos</li>
  <li>Online Shop at your favorite store</li>
</ul>
